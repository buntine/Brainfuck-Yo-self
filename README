This is a very basic interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language. There is no solid standard
for this esoteric language, so it's really just my own dialect. I have provided a few example programs
in this repository.

I've added a little script so you can execute local brainfuck programs:

  ./brainfuck.py examples/hello_world.bf
